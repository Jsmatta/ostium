# Security

QR credentials must be short-lived, signed, bound to the intended unit or device, and validated locally by the ESP32-CAM. The backend must not provide an online "unlock" endpoint.

Store the QR signing key and each device credential outside the repository. Use HTTPS for all user and device traffic, parameterized SQL for SQLite queries, Argon2 password hashes, short-lived user tokens, and role checks on every manager action.

The ESP32 stores only the configuration and revocation data required for offline validation. Treat firmware updates, relay control, device registration, and snapshot access as security-sensitive changes. A revoked credential takes effect on a device after its next successful configuration poll.
